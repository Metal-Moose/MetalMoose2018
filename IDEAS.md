# Robotics TO-DO

## Drive Station
- Synchronization
- Installing putty
- Install 7-Zip
- RGB + RPi stripes, depending on a variable (sound?)
- Correctly velcro the drive station laptops, controllers
- Fix the wiring inside
	
## Autonomous
- Command for driving and turning
- More optional parameters for the commands
	- Optional parameters will have upper + lower case too - same with commands
- Make autonomodes on the left easily reverted
- Stop resetting the angle that the robot is in after each command... it only makes it inaccurate
- Ditch the coordinate system
- Scale control: drive all the way to the right of the scale, elevate, turn, spit, elevate down, then get a cube and do it from the side - either scale or switch
- Fudge constant to alter robot speed during autonomous
- More autonomous modes to choose from
- Put them on the SmartDashboard!
- Speed up autonomous driving!
- Split drive command

## Gameplay
- Drive full-on into the null zone
- Hanger - does not actually need to be in the middle to do
- Better communication - figure out calls between me, Daelan and Larry

## Robot Control
- Disable fourbar control by the user (elevator up - fourbar up. Elevator down - fourbar down only if on the ground
- Elevator - add the slow-down of the function only one way (up when going up, down when going down)
- Elevator - make the function that controls the elevator faster
- Slower the turning speed of the robot, so I have more control
