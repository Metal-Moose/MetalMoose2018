# TODO

## Get the elevator to work and integrate into code
* Slowing speed of the robot (turning and driving) when high
* Further it is up, slower it is (using a function)
* 3 correct autonomous positions
* For reference: getRaw() on the top is 29728, hard stops are 34.125 in 

## Fix the autonomous
* Figure out autonomous sequences
* Figure out input from positions and field layout

## SmartDashboard
* Figure out, what we need to add (and what we will need for the match)
* Add camera to SmartDashboard

## Production / Testing branch
* Have 2 branches - one for debugging and one for the actual matches
	* These will differ in printing to console, having PID values on the SmartDashboard...
