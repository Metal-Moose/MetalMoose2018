# TODO
## Get the elevator to work and integrate into code
* Slowing speed of the robot (turning and driving) when high
* Further it is up, slower it is (using a function)
* 3 correct autonomous positions
* For reference: getRaw() on the top is 29728, hard stops are 34.125 in 

## Fix the autonomous
* Initialize values in the actual drive commands
* Figure out autonomous sequences
* Figure out input from positions and field layout
